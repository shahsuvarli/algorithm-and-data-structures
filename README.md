# Algorithm and Data Structures Course

This project is dedicated to the Algorithm and Data Structures course I am currently taking. It contains various code solutions to problems from LeetCode, a popular platform for coding practice and technical interviews.

## Contents

- **Two pointers**
- **Sliding window**

## Structure

Each directory corresponds to a specific data structure or algorithm topic and contains multiple solutions to related problems. Each solution includes:

- Leetcon problem link
- Solution code

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the relevant directory.
2. Open the file corresponding to the problem you are interested in.
3. Review the problem description and solution.

## Contributions

Feel free to contribute by adding new solutions or improving existing ones. Please follow the existing structure and include detailed explanations and complexity analysis for each solution.

Happy coding!
